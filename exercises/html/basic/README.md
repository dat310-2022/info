## Exercise #4b: Advanced lists

Building on the previous exercise, make the following changes:

  - Use squares as list markers (instead of bullets) for the unordered list.
  - Use roman lowercase numbers for numbering the nested ordered list.

  - See [this page](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp) for how to change list markers.
  - See [this page](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp) for reference on ordered lists.

## Exercise #8: Links within a page

Make a HTML page with a several paragraphs of text, such that the content doesn't fit on the screen and requires scrolling.
(In situations, when only some placeholder text is needed, web developers commonly use Lorem Ipsum as a dummy filler text. There are many websites for generating blocks of lorem ipsum text, e.g., [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/).)

  - Add a link at the top that jumps to the bottom of the page.
  - Add a link at the bottom that jumps to the top of the page.

## Exercise #9: Images

For this exercise and the next, you'll need to save the files on your local computer (i.e., won't work with the w3school try-it editor).

  - Make an _images_ folder and save [images/octocat.png](images/octocat.png) in that folder.
  - Create a HTML page and include this image in three different sizes:
    * The original size.
    * 25% of the original size.
    * Setting the height of the image to 50px.
  - Make each each image a link (surround `<img>` with `<a>..</a>`)
    * The first image should point to _github.com_.
    * The second and third images should point to the original image and open in a new window.

## Exercise 10: Images from the Web

Make a table with the top-3 places you would like to visit.

  - Create thumbnails of the original images on your local computer.
    * Save the original images to your computer then resize them. Resizing can be done, e.g., with Microsoft Paint ([see how](http://www.wikihow.com/Resize-an-Image-in-Microsoft-Paint)).
    * Make all thumbnails of the same size.

  - The rest of the content is arranged in a 2-by-2 table.
  - The top row contains one image per cell.
    * Display the images in 128x128px size.
    * The image files, _sadface.png_ and _happyface.png_, are located under the _images_ folder.
    * Put links on the images that point to _http://sadsite.com_ and _http://happysite.com_.
    * The links should open in a new browser window.
  - The cells in the bottom row are merged together and contain a paragraph with the text "If you wanted an intelligent answer, you should have given me an intelligent question."
  - You don't need to use any CSS in this exercise! (The table borders in the figure are just for illustration.)


## Exercise #12: Your favorite YouTube videos

  - Structure the content of the page using HTML5 elements
  - Make a `<header>` element for the page title "My favorite YouTube videos" (which should be in `<h1>`)

    * A title in `<h2>`
    * An embedded YouTube video (using `<iframe>`)
    * Check [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en) for how to find the correct link.
