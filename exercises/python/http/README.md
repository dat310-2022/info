# Python HTTP exercises

## Exercise #0: Test HTTP server

Launch the [example Python HTTP server](../../../examples/python/http/server.py) and test it by making a request to it both from a browser and using curl.


## Exercise #1: POST requests

Extend the HTTP server to be able to handle POST requests.
Test it by making a post request using curl.
* You can use [this example](https://blog.anvileight.com/posts/simple-python-http-server/#do-get)

## Exercise #2: Form handling

Use the server provided [here](exercise2.py).
Make a HTML form with some input fields and set its action such that it is submitted to your Python HTTP server (using GET). 

  - See [urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) for extracting input variables from the URL


## Exercise #3: Form handling (POST)

Extend the previous exercise such that the form is submitted using POST.
